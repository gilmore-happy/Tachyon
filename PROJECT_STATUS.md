# Solana MEV Bot Project Status

## Current Status: Fully Functional with Empty Cache - Ready for Pool Data

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Fixed environment setup (.env file created with proper configuration)
2. ✅ Fixed compilation errors in raydium_amm program
3. ✅ Fixed compilation errors in lb_clmm program  
4. ✅ Fixed import issues in main codebase
5. ✅ Created all necessary cache directories
6. ✅ Created empty cache JSON files with proper structure:
   - raydium-clmm-markets.json ({"data": []})
   - orca-markets.json ({})
   - orca-whirpools-markets.json ([])
   - raydium-markets.json ([])
   - meteora-markets.json ([])
7. ✅ Fixed ALL Windows-style paths to Unix-style:
   - src/markets/orca.rs (fixed backslash paths)
   - src/markets/raydium.rs (fixed backslash paths)
   - src/markets/orca_whirpools.rs (fixed backslash paths AND filename issue)
   - src/markets/meteora.rs (fixed backslash paths)
8. ✅ Created needed output directories:
   - best_paths_selected/ for storing arbitrage strategies

### Recent Fixes (June 5, 2025):
1. ✅ Fixed token handling to work with native SOL token
2. ✅ Fixed WebSocket URL to correctly use devnet endpoint
3. ✅ Fixed code warnings and improved code quality:
   - Removed unused imports
   - Fixed unnecessary parentheses
   - Converted camelCase variables to snake_case
   - Added proper error handling for unused Results
   - Fixed struct field naming conventions
4. ✅ Successfully ran the bot with minimal configuration
5. ✅ Verified the bot produces the expected output files

### Configuration Improvements (June 6, 2025):
1. ✅ Implemented centralized configuration system via config.json
2. ✅ Created config generation utility (generate-config.sh)
3. ✅ Added string-based enum compatibility for better config file flexibility
4. ✅ Fixed case sensitivity issues in DexLabel enum usage
5. ✅ Fixed field naming inconsistencies (tokenMintA → token_mint_a)
6. ✅ Added dynamic strategy selection based on configuration

### Performance Improvements (June 6, 2025):
1. ✅ Designed parallel processing architecture for key bottlenecks
2. ✅ Implemented concurrent market data fetching in pools.rs
3. ✅ Implemented parallelized path simulation with controlled concurrency
4. ✅ Added parallel strategy execution for maximum CPU utilization
5. ⚠️ Implementation complete but has compilation issues to resolve

### Current State:
- ✅ Bot runs successfully on devnet
- ✅ All file path issues have been resolved
- ✅ Bot successfully loads DEX structures (though pools are empty)
- ✅ Fee cache is correctly updating
- ✅ Centralized configuration system implemented
- ✅ Parallel processing architecture has been designed and implemented
- ⚠️ WebSocket connection fails but bot continues without it (non-critical)
- ⚠️ Cache files are empty - bot is monitoring 0 pools
- ⚠️ Some field naming inconsistencies still present in the codebase
- ⚠️ Parallel processing implementation has compilation issues to resolve

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Bot verification complete - successfully starts and runs
2. ✅ Implement centralized configuration system
3. ✅ Design parallel processing architecture
4. Fix compilation issues in parallel processing implementation
5. Populate cache files with pool data (either manually or via fetch functions)
6. Test arbitrage detection and execution with real pools
7. Benchmark parallel vs. sequential performance
8. Monitor for any runtime errors with populated data
9. Optimize WebSocket connection (optional)

### Bot Architecture Overview:
- **DEX Support**: Raydium (AMM & CLMM), Orca (Standard & Whirlpools), Meteora
- **Execution Modes**: Live trading, Paper trading, Simulation
- **Fee Strategies**: Dynamic priority fees based on network conditions
- **Cache System**: JSON files for pool data to reduce API calls

### Technical Details:
- The bot expects different JSON structures for different DEXes:
  - Raydium CLMM: {"data": []}
  - Orca: {} (HashMap)
  - Others: [] (Array)
- All file paths use forward slashes (/) consistently
- Cache files are located in src/markets/cache/
- Output files are stored in best_paths_selected/
- Configuration is managed through config.json in project root
- Available strategies: Massive, BestPath, Optimism, All
- Available execution modes: Simulate, Paper, Live
- Available fee modes: Conservative, ProfitBased, Aggressive

### Environment:
- Running on devnet for testing
- Using wallet: 695hQs4AS4bHK5yFteTLLaWKFFrW8y644SBhysm9RTZT
- RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
- WebSocket URL: wss://radial-icy-meme.solana-devnet.quiknode.pro/cc14da2b3b4ca58af137aa9b9b178aed4b57e7b7/

### Notes on Cache System:
- Bot can start with empty cache files but won't have pools to monitor
- Each DEX module has fetch functions to populate cache from APIs
- Cache improves startup time and reduces API calls
- Bot can discover new pools dynamically via on-chain queries
