# Solana MEV Bot Project Status

## Current Status: Path Issues Fixed - Ready for Testing

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Fixed environment setup (.env file created with proper configuration)
2. ✅ Fixed compilation errors in raydium_amm program
3. ✅ Fixed compilation errors in lb_clmm program  
4. ✅ Fixed import issues in main codebase
5. ✅ Created all necessary cache directories
6. ✅ Created empty cache JSON files with proper structure:
   - raydium-clmm-markets.json ({"data": []})
   - orca-markets.json ({})
   - orca-whirpools-markets.json ([])
   - raydium-markets.json ([])
   - meteora-markets.json ([])
7. ✅ Fixed ALL Windows-style paths to Unix-style:
   - src/markets/orca.rs (fixed backslash paths)
   - src/markets/raydium.rs (fixed backslash paths)
   - src/markets/orca_whirpools.rs (fixed backslash paths AND filename issue)
   - src/markets/meteora.rs (fixed backslash paths)

### Recent Fixes (June 3, 2025):
1. ✅ Fixed orca_whirpools.rs file path issue:
   - Changed from "orca_whirpools-markets.json" to "orca-whirpools-markets.json"
   - Fixed both read and write paths
2. ✅ Fixed meteora.rs Windows-style paths:
   - Changed from "src\\markets\\cache\\meteora-markets.json" to Unix-style
   - Fixed in both read and write locations

### Current State:
- ✅ All file path issues have been resolved
- ✅ Bot should now be able to start and load all DEX pools
- ⚠️ WebSocket connection may fail (non-critical - bot continues without it)
- ⚠️ Cache files are empty - bot will start with 0 pools

### Next Steps:
1. Run the bot to verify it starts successfully
2. Populate cache files with pool data (either manually or via fetch functions)
3. Test arbitrage detection and execution
4. Monitor for any runtime errors

### Bot Architecture Overview:
- **DEX Support**: Raydium (AMM & CLMM), Orca (Standard & Whirlpools), Meteora
- **Execution Modes**: Live trading, Paper trading, Simulation
- **Fee Strategies**: Dynamic priority fees based on network conditions
- **Cache System**: JSON files for pool data to reduce API calls

### Technical Details:
- The bot expects different JSON structures for different DEXes:
  - Raydium CLMM: {"data": []}
  - Orca: {} (HashMap)
  - Others: [] (Array)
- All file paths now use forward slashes (/) consistently
- Cache files are located in src/markets/cache/

### Environment:
- Running on devnet for testing
- Using wallet: 695hQs4AS4bHK5yFteTLLaWKFFrW8y644SBhysm9RTZT
- RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com

### Notes on Cache System:
- Bot can start with empty cache files but won't have pools to monitor
- Each DEX module has fetch functions to populate cache from APIs
- Cache improves startup time and reduces API calls
- Bot can discover new pools dynamically via on-chain queries
